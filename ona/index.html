                  Everything we do is built around trying to communicate from and to the
                  human. Our experience of diverse clients and conversations means that
                  you can trust us to collaborate with you to deliver audience and
                  brand-appropriate narratives.

                <p>
                  Sometimes people have to do things that make them uncomfortable. Some
                  people have years of polished media training and other people are nervous,
                  and we get it. We will come and meet you where you are, and we will work
                  together for as long as it takes for you to be happy and for us to have
                  what your story needs. We prefer natural performances and have lots of
                  tips and tricks to get you there.
                </p>

                <p>
                  But, we will always work within your limits, even if that means
                  stepping away.

              <h2>Discretion</h2>

              <div class='hover'>
                <p>
                  We regularly work with organisations at the edge of innovation, so a lot
                  of what we do is bound by strict confidentiality. We also work across brands
                  competing in the same space, and so discretion is absolutely key. We'll open
                  a discussion if we think that something isn't quite right for you, <em>because
                  we really care about work being as good as it can be.</em> 
                </p>
                <p> 
                  We have been
                  everywhere from conflict zones to government buildings, and worked with
                  refugees, NGOs, CEOs, and heads of state.

              <h2>Building Motivation</h2>
              <div class='hover'>
                <p>
                  As organisations grow or shift focus it's important to bring team members
                  along with you, and allow space for reflection and conversation. We will help
                  you tell concise stories so people can follow the journey, understand change,
                  and want to be a part of it.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We will meet users together, watch how innovation affects them, and stay
                  excited about the future you're building.

              <div class='hover'>
                <p>
                  Storytelling is a powerful tool for communicating brands and ideas to people.
                  It's also a really powerful tool for listening and critically analysing where
                  organisations are, and how they can do better.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We believe any form of spatial, social, digital or material design can learn
                  from storytelling. We regularly teach design and mediation narratives in
                  universities, and work with small groups on conflict mediation.

                  For three years we have worked inside design teams at ustwo,
                  helping connect designers to users to help push towards the
                  digital transformation of global brands. Our advanced interview
                  skills move sets of questions that designers have into rich and
                  transformative conversations, that get to the core of why
                  design matters. These stories then support decks, and circulate
                  in the client organisations, bringing everyone along on the
                  design journey.

                  We were commissioned to make some fundraising videos for this
                  innovative children's hospital. Having met them on another project,
                  they appreciated the gentleness of our approach around fraught
                  medical teams, worried parents, and sick children. We love this
                  hospital and the wonderful people who work there. There was lots
                  of laughter, and (happy!) tears, during the shoots. The good news
                  is that all fundraising goals were reached, and they got to buy
                  some amazing equipment!

                For the Toronto International Film Festival's 40th birthday we were invited to spend a month in
                  residence in the Archives and create a different cinema reel for
                  each day of the festival. We sifted through hundreds of hours of
                  interviews, photographs and premieres to create thoughtful celebrations
                  of the amazing worlds that cinema can show us.

                  We were commissioned to follow an innovative All-Party Parliamentary
                  Group researching food banks and food poverty in the London borough.
                  We supported and recorded the interviews of users, staff, and private
                  sector bodies, and prepared a short film that was screened in the House
                  of Commons. We believe strongly in real putting faces or voices behind
                  reports, and ensuring safeguarding and dignity in production.
